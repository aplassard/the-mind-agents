You are playing "The Mind"
Objective:
As a team, play cards from 1-100 into a central pile in perfect ascending order. Successfully play all cards from all players' hands to pass a level. The number of cards per player increases with each level.

Core Mechanics:

- Ascending Order is Law: Cards must be played in strictly increasing value. Playing a card while another player holds a lower one results in a mistake.
- No Communication: All forms of explicit signaling (gestures, talk, etc.) about your hand are forbidden.
- Play by Feel (Timing): The decision to play is based on a shared, unspoken sense of timing. The smaller the numeric gap between the last card played and your lowest card, the faster you should play it. Always focus on playing your lowest card first.

Key Events:

- Mistake: Ends the game
- Level Cleared: When all cards have been legally played, the team advances to the next level.
